/// @technical
///
/// ## Why constraints rather than labels
///
/// A pianist's two hands each reach about a tenth with five fingers, and a guitarist's fretting hand covers four frets with one note a string, so a set of notes no hands could play is mostly the engine reading overtones as notes.
///
/// The models keep the most of the sounding energy that hands could play, and move a hand only after the notes have left its reach for a while, as a player's hand stays put between phrases.
///
/// ## Where the player is playing now
///
/// A note struck in the last kRecentMs weighs 32 times its level more, so a loud strike outweighs all the held notes together and a hand goes where new notes are struck rather than where the loudest sound holds; a click with no level weighs nothing more: a solo above a loud chord or bass pulls the hand up the neck or the keyboard, as it pulls the player's.
