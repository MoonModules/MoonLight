# Installation

## MoonLight Web installer

Install Moonlight onto an ESP32 using the MoonLight Web installer

* **Step 1**: Get an **ESP32 or ESP32-S3** (preferred, support large setups and Live Scripts). Boards we use are [ESP32](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EyrmQyw) or [ESP32-S3](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBAtJ2H), but most of the ESP32 and ESP32-S3 boards will work. Get a **WS2812 LED-strip** or a [LED-panel](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EGx8Hhu) (preferred to see 2D effects). Connect the strip or panel to the board on a suitable pin (e.g. Pin 2 or 16).

* **Step 2**: Connect an ESP32 via USB

* **Step 3**: Go to the web installer: [MoonLight Web Installer](https://raw.githack.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/refs/heads/main/firmware/installer/index.html). The Web Installer works on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge or similar browsers, not on Safari. Select your board, or if not listed, press others.

* **Step 5**: Choose to **erase** the board first or not. Erase if you have a new board or want to start fresh. Do not erase if you want to update an existing MoonLight installation. Erase deletes all settings and requires to re-connect to WiFi.

   * If you ran previous versions of MoonLight, the UI might not show up. In this case it is needed to reload the UI from the device:
      * Chrome: Command Shift R (Mac) or Ctrl Shift R or Control Reload (Windows)
      * Safari: Reload from Origin : Option Shift R
      * After this not all UI elements might be immediately visible. If you see 'MoonLight loading ...' in the browser, just wait a bit. 
      * Sometimes it migh be needed to clear the browser cache:
         * Chrome: Delete Browsing data / delete data
         * Safari: Empty cache: Develop (enable if not visible in the Safare Menu) / empty caches (Command Option E)
         * More info: [how to hard refresh your browser and clear cache](https://fabricdigital.co.nz/blog/how-to-hard-refresh-your-browser-and-clear-cache)
   * The device will show in 'Captive portal'. Alternatively you can close the captive portal and show it in a browser using http://4.3.2.1

* **Step 3**: Enter your local **WiFi network credentials** and hostname:

   * Add a driver node, FastLED driver is best to start with if you have a normal (ws2812) LED strip or panel. Choose the Physical driver if you have more then 4 LED strips or panels or non standard LEDS (e.g. RGBW lights, curtains...).
