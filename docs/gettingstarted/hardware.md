# Hardware

To get started the minimal you need is an esp32-device connected via USB to your computer and a LED-strip or panel connected via 3 wires to the vcc, ground and a supported gpio pin of the esp32 (e.g. Pin 2). An ESP32-S3 is preferred as it has more memory to support large setups and Live Scripts. 

## Minimal hardware

* One of the ESP32-devices show in [MoonLight Web Installer](https://raw.githack.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/refs/heads/main/firmware/installer/index.html). [ESP32-S3 N16R8](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBAtJ2H) recommended. Optional [Expansion board 44pin](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EJhmlIE)
* Any WS2812 LED strip or panel. [256 LED panel](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EIKoYrg) recommended.
* Connect the ESP32-device with USB to your computer, connect the LED strip or panel

Above is the minimum requirement to have lights burning.
