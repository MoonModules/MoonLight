# Develop Overview

* [Start developing for MoonLight](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/overview/)
    * [ESP32 Sveltekit](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/esp32sveltekit/)

## Where you can help

* Improve the web installer
* Improve the UI (Svelte 5, DaisyUI 5, TailWind 4)
  * Mutli row layout
  * Set Dark / light theme or auto
* Tune FastLED, add FastLED 2D effects
* CI automation (Generate daily builds in Github and use by installer)

## Developing

* Read the [ESP32 Sveltekit docs](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/esp32sveltekit/)
* Read [Customizing Sveltekit](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/customizingsveltekit/)
* Instead of cloning the repo directly from MoonLight as described above, create a fork first so you have your own environment to make changes to. See also Pull Requests below.
* UI dev: configure vite.config.ts, go to interface folder, npm install, npm run dev. A local webserver starts on localhost. UI changes will directly be shown via this webserver
* Changes made to the UI are not always visible in the browser, issue with caching / max-age (üöß), clear the browser cache to see latest UI.
* Serial Log shows which code is from which library using emoji:

    * üêº: ESP-SvelteKit
    * üîÆ: PsychicHTTP
    * üê∏: Live Scripts
    * üåô: MoonBase
    * üí´: MoonLight
    üåô and üí´ is also used in code comments of ESP32-SvelteKit to show where changes to upstream have been made.
* The following ESP32-SvelteKit features have been switched off in the default builts (they can be switched on if you want to use them, see [features.ini](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/blob/main/features.ini))
    *   -D FT_SECURITY=0
    *   -D FT_SLEEP=0
    *   -D FT_BATTERY=0 (enabled in some firmwares e.g. esp32-s3-stephanelec-16p)

## Installation - Developer

* Open GitKraken (or any other GitHub client). Press + / New tab and select Clone a Repo (Or another git management tool)
* Select the folder on your local drive where to copy to (e.g. /github/ewowi)
* Copy [MoonLight.git](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight.git) and paste in the URL field of GitKraken
* Press clone the repo
* Open VSCode
* Install the PlatformIO IDE extension, if not already done so.
* Open the folder created with GitKraken
* Connect an ESP32 or an ESP32-S3 with USB to your computer
* On the status bar select the env to flash and the board to flash to
    * Select esp32dev for a normal ESP32
    * Select esp32-s3-devkitc-1-n16r8v for an ESP32-S3 ([recommended](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBAtJ2H) or similar)

* Press PlaformIO:Upload (->) on the statusbar
* The firmware is now flashed to your board, after flashing the board will reboot
* Recommended: Press PlatformIO:Serial Monitor to see the debug information produced

* Issues
    * If the board AP is not showing up in your WiFi list it might be helpful to fully erase the board before flashing (vscode üëΩ, Erase flash)
    * Sometimes the Serial log may show: [  5817][W][WiFiGeneric.cpp:1408] setTxPower(): Neither AP or STA has been started. This is from setTxPower in APSettingsService. Delay has been added to prevent this. 

## Pull Requests

* Want to make changes: fork the repo and submit pull requests, see [creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork):

    * Login to your own github account
    * Fork: go to [MoonModules/MoonLight](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/) and press Fork, uncheck 'Copy the main branch only' and press Create Fork. You will be moved to your fork of MoonLight
    * Press Branches, press New Branch, give it a name e.g. background-script and press Create new Branch, click on background-script

## Adding functionality

### UI
üöß

* nodejs
* /interface folder
* npm install and npm run dev
* WWWData.h

### Server

There are 3 levels to add functionality:

* **Standard ESP32-Sveltekit code**, e.g. Connections, Wifi and System. MoonBase files is also made using standard sveltekit as example but contains a few components used in MoonLight modules. Might be rewriteen as MoonLight Module in the future.
* [MoonLight Modules](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/modules/) e.g. Lights Control, Effects, Info, Channels. They are subclasses of Modules.h/cpp and implement setupDefinition, onUpdate and optional loop. New modules need to be defined in main.cpp and added to menu.svelte. All further UI is generated by Module.svelte.
* **MoonLight Nodes**: the easiest and recommended way. See Effects.h, Layouts.h, Modifiers.h and Mods.h for examples. They match closest WLED usermods. Each node has controls, a setup and a loop and can be switched on and off. For specific purposes hasLayout and hasModifier can be set.

### Adding a Board Definition

Before starting, ensure you have the datasheet of your particular chip and board confirmed and available. Many modules have near-identical markings that can hide varying hardware.

There are 3 files to consider when making a board definition.

	boards/BOARD_NAME.csv
	boards/BOARD_NAME.JSON
	firmware/BOARD_TYPE_NAME.ini (e.g. esp32dev, esp32-s3), contains different boards

### Technical notes

#### Live Scripts

* Uses ESPLiveScripts, see compileAndRun. compileAndRun is started when in Nodes a file.sc is choosen
    * To do: kill running scripts, e.g. when changing effects

#### File Manager

## Technical

* filesState: all files on FS
* folderList: all files in a folder
* editableFile: current file
* getState / postFilesState: get filesState and post changes to files (update, delete, new)
* addFile / addFolder: create new items
* breadcrumbs(String): folder path as string array and as string, stored in localStorage
* folderListFromBreadCrumbs: create folderList of current folder
* handleEdit: when edit button pressed: navigate back and forward through folders, edit current file
* confirmDelete: when delete button pressed
* socket files / handleFileState (->folderListFromBreadCrumbs)

Using component FileEdit, see [Components](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/components/#fileedit)
