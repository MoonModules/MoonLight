!!! info "pioarduino IDE"

     PlatformIO IDE is default but as we are using latest esp-idf, pioarduino IDE is needed when PlatformIO IDE fails.

**Step 3**: * Open the downloaded MoonLight repository 


## Build and upload

**Step 1**: Build

* Press ‚òëÔ∏è in the bottom statusbar

    <img width="320" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e6faf4a-f169-46e4-a2f8-5d4021516a04" />


* If you compile for the first time it take some time to finish (‚òïÔ∏è)

    <img width="320" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5655c00-6b91-4745-ae22-39f8573ae05a" />
    <img width="320" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d21319d-2e86-473e-9e5a-d500ecb462c8" />

**Step 2**: Upload MoonLight to an ESP32-device

* Connect an ESP32-device via USB and select the device using the (second) üîå icon in the staturbar. See [Hardware](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/gettingstarted/hardware/).   

!!! info "USB-to-serial chip drivers"

    In some cases, ESP32-devices won't show connected. See USB-to-serial chip drivers at [MoonLight Web Installer](https://raw.githack.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/refs/heads/main/firmware/installer/index.html) 

* Erase the device if it is a new device or the device has not been used for MoonModules before: go to üëΩ in the left menu and select Erase Flash

    <img width="350" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/322bb30e-2709-43de-bd68-80044c9a0673" />

* Press upload (‚û°Ô∏è) in the status bar

    <img width="350" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4cbda64-739c-410d-9cdc-d2645e24c7ba" />

* The firmware is now flashed to your ESP32 device, after flashing the ESP32 device will reboot

!!! tip "Serial Monitor"
    Recommended: Press PlatformIO:Serial Monitor to see the debug information produced (the first üîå on the VSCode statusbar)

    <img width="350" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c925d883-173b-4288-89d4-4770c2d86a02" />

**Step 3**: Connect to MoonLight

Before changing code, test if the current download of MoonLight is running fine. Follow the instructions in [Connect MoonLight](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/gettingstarted/installation/#connect-moonlight) and [Setup MoonLight](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/gettingstarted/installation/#setup-moonlight).

* If you are developing or updating existing MoonLight installations MoonLight might be outdated or not show up correctly in the browser or not even appear. Two reasons

    * Sometimes the latest front end code is not generated yet (WWWData.h). This is how to set it right: 
        * Open platformIO new terminal (>_)
        * touch ./interface/src/app.html so the build process will be triggered to create a new WWWData.h
        * build the project (‚úî) - if nodejs is not installed (yet) you will get errors. See troubleshooting
        * check in your github manager (gitkraken of github desktop) that a new WWWData.h is created

    * An old version is cached in the browser. See [UI not showing when installing new version of MoonLight](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/gettingstarted/installation/#connect-moonlight) how to solve that.

* A MoonLight device can be accessed via it's IP address or via [http://ml-home.local](http://ml-home.local). The latter uses MDNS.

!!! tip "ESP32Devices"
    IF you want to know which MoonLight (or WLED) devices run on your network, use [ESP32Devices](https://github.com/ewowi/ESP32Devices) to discover the ESP32 nodes on your network

## Troubleshooting

!!! info "supporting tools"

     * Optionally you need to install git and nodejs, run npm install and make sure python > v3.10 in VSCode.
     * Instead of Platformio IDE, the pioarduino IDE extension might be needed in VSCode


### Git install

* When git is not installed on your system, [download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install, restart VSCode and press ‚òëÔ∏è again

    * Windows:

        <img width="320" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d39c637-c7dc-4c34-b177-f8eb63d54863" />
    
    * MacOS

        <img width="320" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c27943-6046-4fd7-aab4-3c91544f761d" />

!!! info "Install git on MacOS"

    * Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh): will take a while: ‚òïÔ∏è
    * Install git using homebrew (replace <user> with your user name):
     
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    echo >> /Users/<user>/.zprofile
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<user>/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

    brew install git
    ```

### Python and LZMA

!!! warning "MacOS: Python and LZMA"

    In some cases LZMA support must be installed

    <img width="320" height="50" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 at 13 58 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eef658f-f297-46cd-bbd5-4d769dbf9e56" />

    * Run in VSCode / pio shell ([>_])

    ```
    brew install xz

    python -V
    ```

    * python -V should show a version > 3.10 (e.g. 3.11.7)



### Install nodejs

nodejs is needed if changes on the frontend (UI) are made (interface folder). On each file change, ‚òëÔ∏è or ‚û°Ô∏è will rebuild the UI using nodejs.

* Windows: if nodejs is not on your system you will get this error:

    <img width="640" height="221" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 212255" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f05ca8d2-6485-4965-8b75-edd4b468ddf4" />

    * download [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) if it is not run in admin mode you will get this:

    <img width="640" height="501" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 212842" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9945217f-7b4a-4b97-87df-3b35b61ccc0a" />

    * if this is the case, run an administrator command prompt and run the downloaded .msi file as follows:

    <img width="649" height="510" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 220442" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/144cce1d-bc59-471c-ace3-aa38c52629e4" />
    <img width="640" height="498" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 214052" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/affb20e8-785e-471d-98d9-855e5783ce5e" />

    * after succesful install of nodejs run ‚òëÔ∏è or ‚û°Ô∏è again. It might be needed to rebuild node_modules and package-lock.json if you see this

    <img width="640" height="688" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 214700" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b92ccba0-17e1-4434-929e-302ec8afd96e" />

    * Remove node_modules and package-lock.json - run as administrator if the OS complains!
    * Rebuild node_modules and package-lock.json by opening a VSCode shell using [>_] in the statusbar
``` 
cd interface 
npm install
```
    * If that give errors set execution policies as follows:

    <img width="640" height="398" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 215039" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629bc8de-d1ce-4d2d-9a92-e08bc9d31d4b" />

    * Press run ‚òëÔ∏è or ‚û°Ô∏è again it should now complete succesfully

    <img width="640" height="571" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 220023" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd6754f4-d6df-446a-94fe-c3d7f491be59" />

* MacOS

    * Go to [nodejs download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    * Get a prebuilt Node.js¬Æ for macOS running a ARM64 architecture (for modern Mx MacBooks)
    * Choose maxOS Installer (.pkg)
    * Next Next Finish Done
    * Press run ‚òëÔ∏è or ‚û°Ô∏è again it should now complete succesfully (if needed restart VSCode)
    * If still errors, Remove node_modules and package-lock.json, cd interface, npm install and repeat previous step

!!! info "Ignore DragDropList error"
    This error will show up in the logging
    ```
    node_modules/svelte-dnd-list/DragDropList.svelte (595:3): Error when using sourcemap for reporting an error: Can't resolve original location of error.
    ```
    Just ignore it.

* Check serial output

* Go to [development](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/development/) for further info on developing MoonBase / MoonLight functionality.

### Other troubles
* In general: first close and restart VSCode and run ‚òëÔ∏è or ‚û°Ô∏è again.
* python > 3.10: install python (3.11.13) in the VSCode shell (not in a normal os terminal)
* esptool.py not downloaded: deinstall platformIO IDE and install pioarduino IDE extensions (required for support of latest esp-idf 5.5)
* Run everything from within VSCode, close any alternative / external tools which (potentially) access esp32 devices. They can claim resources or send commands to the device which interfere with what we trying to accomplish here.
* If the ESP32 device AP is not showing up in your WiFi list it might be helpful to fully erase the ESP32 device before flashing (VSCode üëΩ, Erase flash)
* Sometimes the Serial log may show: [5817][W][WiFiGeneric.cpp:1408] setTxPower(): Neither AP or STA has been started. This is from setTxPower in APSettingsService. Delay has been added to prevent this.
