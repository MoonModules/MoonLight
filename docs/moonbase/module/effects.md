## Overview

The Effects module defines effects and modifiers. They run in a 'layer'. 

* Effect ðŸ”¥: An animation running in a layer, e.g. a graphical equalizer or game of life. Effects can run in 1D, 2D or 3D coordinate spaces.
* Modifier ðŸ’Ž: An effect on an effect e.g. mirror, multiply or rotate. See [Modifiers](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/modifiers/)
* Layer: An area on a (LED) display. Effects and modifier run in this area. Each layer maps a coordinate space to the display

!!! info "One layer"

    Until v0.6.0 there is only one layer, projected on the whole display. Multiple layers is planned after v0.6.0

!!! info "3D"

    MoonLight is build from the ground to support 3D. First there where LED strips, later LED matrices and now also 3D shapes like spheres or cubes, making it suitable for art-installations. 1D and 2D objects can be seen as 3D objects where some dimensions have a width of 1. Most effects are 1D or 2D, they will slowly be adapted to support also 3D, furthermore modifiers can be used to project 1D on 2D or 2D on 3D layouts.

## Controls

* Layer: Choose the layer - currently only one layer supported
    * Start, End and Brightness: read only for now, when multiple layers are implemented (>v0.6.0), these can be set per layer
* Effects and modifiers will be shown as nodes with controls
    * Reorder: Nodes can be reordered, defining the order of executions
        * effects: which effect on top of the other effect. 
        * Modifiers: which modifier is done first, e.g. circle then multiply will yield to a different result than multiply then circle
    * Controls. A node can be switched on and off and has custom controls, which defines the parameters of the node (e.g. effect speed).

## Effect ðŸ”¥ Nodes

Below is a list of effects in MoonLight. This list will grow with each release. Want to add an effect, call us.
