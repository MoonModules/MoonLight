# Layouts

A layout (ðŸš¥) defines the positions of lights connected to a MoonLight device.

* The **coordinates** of each light are defined in a 3D coordinate space 
    * Coordinates needs to be specified in the order the lights are wired so MoonLight knows which light is first, which is second etc.
    * For lights in a straight line (1D, e.g. LED strips or a LED bar), specify coordinates as [x,0,0] 
    * For lights in a flat area (2D, e.g. LED matrix), specify coordinates as [x,y,0] 
* **Multiple layout nodes** can be defined which will be mapped in the order of the layouts
* MoonLight will use the layout definition to generate a **mapping** of the effects to a real world light layout. Most simple example is a panel which has a snake layout. The mapping will create a layer for effects where the snake layout is hidden.
* Layouts also assign groups of LEDs to esp32 GPIO pins.

## Layout ðŸš¥ Nodes

Below is a list of Layouts in MoonLight. 
Want to add a a Layout to MoonLight, see [develop](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/overview/). See also [Live scripts](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonlight/livescripts/) to add runtime effects.

!!! warning "Choosing pins"

    Choose the right pins with care. See also the IO module to see which pins can in general be used for LEDs (ðŸ’¡). But depending on a specific boards some pins might also be in use already. 

!!! tip "Multiple layouts"
    Single line, single row or panel are suitable layouts to combine into a larger fixture.

### SE16

16 channel LED strip driver by Stephane Electronics

* Leds Per Pin: the number of LEDs connected to each pin
* Pins Are Columns: are the LEDs on a pin a row of the effect (width is 1 (or 2) x ledsPerPin). If not set the LEDs are a column (height is 1 (or 2) x ledsPerPin)
* Mirrored Pins: If set it is assumed that LEDs are connected with increasing positions on 8 pins on one side of the board and decreasing positions on the 8 pins of the other side of the board. The resulting size will have a width of 8 and the height (or width) will be 2 * ledsPerPin. If not set, the width will be 16 and the height (or width) = ledsPerPin
* Pins: 47,48,21,38,14,39,13,40,12,41,11,42,10,2,3,1
