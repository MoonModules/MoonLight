# Modifiers

A modifier (ðŸ’Ž) is an effect on an effect. It can change the size of the effect layer, and moves effect effect pixels around (e.g. rotate) or expand to other dimensions, e.g. a line can become a circle.

!!! tip

    Multiple modifiers can be defined per layer. The order of multipliers matter e.g. rotate then multiply is different then multiply then rotate.

## Modifier ðŸ’Ž Nodes

Below is a list of Modifiers in MoonLight. 
Want to add a Modifier to MoonLight, see [develop](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/overview/). See also [Live scripts](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonlight/livescripts/) to add runtime Modifiers.

The following Modifiers are defined in MoonLight. Some found there origin in WLED and WLED-MM (Expand1D):

| RippleYZ ðŸ§Š | ![RippleYZ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0918efac-6367-420f-b0e3-d796d9551953) | <img width="320" alt="RippleYZ" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90ecf22c-c4c1-4ee9-8096-fd5613fbb1a7" /> | 1D/2D effect will be rippled to 2D/3D (ðŸš¨)<br>Shrink: shrinks the original size towards Y and Z, towardsY: copies X into Y, towardsZ: copies XY into Z |

ðŸš¨: some effects already do this theirselves e.g. FreqMatrix runs on 1D but copies to 2D and 3D if size allows.
