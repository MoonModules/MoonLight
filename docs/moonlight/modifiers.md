# Modifiers

A modifier (ðŸ’Ž) is an effect on an effect. It can change the size of the effect layer, and moves effect effect pixels around (e.g. rotate) or expand to other dimensions, e.g. a line can become a circle.

!!! tip

    Multiple modifiers can be defined per layer. The order of multipliers matter e.g. rotate then multiply is different then multiply then rotate.
